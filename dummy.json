   "description": "Industrial Design is a human-centered problem-solving process driven by creativity, innovation, and research. Its goal is to create and deliver products, services, and communication that enhance the human experience while building business success. Industrial Design bridges the gap between what is and what’s possible. It is a trans-disciplinary profession that harnesses creativity to resolve problems and collaboratively creates solutions with the intent of making a product, space, system, service, experience, or business–better. At its core, Industrial Design provides an optimistic way of looking at the future by reframing problems as opportunities. It links innovation, technology, research, business, and consumer behavior to provide new value and competitive advantage across economic, social, and environmental territories.",
